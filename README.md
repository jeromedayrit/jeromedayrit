I'm a passionate Data Engineer focused on building scalable, secure data pipelines in Azure. With over 10 years of System development experience, I'm transitioning into cloud data architecture, combining my coding background with modern data tools.

### 📂 Featured Projects
- **[Car Sales Analytics - Medallion Architecture](https://github.com/jeromedayrit/rg-salescars-adeproject)**  
This project implements a modern data platform using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to process and analyze car sales data. It simulates an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests raw data, applies transformations, and delivers curated, business-ready insights. The solution is designed to showcase best practices in data engineering, Delta Lake, and Azure-based architecture, providing stakeholders with high-quality, governed data for reporting and decision-making
