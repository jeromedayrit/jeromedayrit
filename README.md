I'm a passionate Data Engineer focused on building scalable, secure data pipelines in Azure. With over 10 years of System development experience, I'm transitioning into cloud data architecture, combining my coding background with modern data tools.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building Azure-based data pipelines using the Medallion Architecture, integrating ADF, Databricks, Synapse and Power BI for real-time analytics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure Data Engineering concepts and best practices

### 📂 Featured Projects
- **[Car Sales Analytics](https://github.com/jeromedayrit/rg-salescars-adeproject)**  
This project implements a modern data platform using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to process and analyze car sales data. It simulates an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests raw data, applies transformations, and delivers curated, business-ready insights. The solution is designed to showcase best practices in data engineering, Delta Lake, and Azure-based architecture, providing stakeholders with high-quality, governed data for reporting and decision-making

- **[AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/jeromedayrit/rg-adventwork-adeproject)** 
This project tackles a key business requirement by implementing a full-scale data pipeline using Azure services. It focuses on extracting customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database, transforming it in the cloud, and delivering actionable insights via a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard showcases critical KPIs such as gender distribution and product category sales, with interactive filters for date, product category, and gender to support informed decision-making.
